In our country the yarn businessmen maintain a lot of register to keep the record of purchase, sell, 
stock, profit, expense, bill etc. All the registers are handled by manager. If a little mistake happens,
it will be very harmful for the business. Moreover the work is always complex for the manager to 
find the wrong data to make the records correct. It also takes a lot of time to maintain these 
registers. Moreover it is always tough to find the amount in the register which is not paid by the 
customer in past .So this application will help the shops of getting information about their business 
and remove the complexity of work, unnecessary errors, and unproductive time.
